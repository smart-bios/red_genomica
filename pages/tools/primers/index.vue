            <p>BatchPrimer3 is a comprehensive web primer design program using Primer3 core program as a major primer design engine to design different types of PCR primers and sequencing primers in a high-through manner. BatchPrimer3 allows users to design several types of primers including generic primers, hybridization oligos, SSR primers together with SSR detection, and SNP genotyping primers (including single-base extension primers, allele-specific primers, and tetra-primers for tetra-primer ARMS PCR), as well as DNA sequencing primers. A batch input of large number of sequences and a tab-delimited result output greatly facilitates rapid primer design and ordering process.</p>
